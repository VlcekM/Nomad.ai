# Changelog

Released with tags `v<version>` by `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which needs a non-empty `## v<version>` section here.
Newest first: the newest heading is also the version of local builds (`Directory.Build.props`).

## v0.1.0

- First release of Nomad.ai, a native Windows client for Claude Code. It starts your installed `claude` CLI and
  drives it over stream-json, so sign-in, settings, MCP servers and sessions are the CLI's own.
- Sessions from `~/.claude/projects` in the sidebar, split into Alive and Idle, with search, history, resume,
  generated titles, rewind and fork.
- Streaming markdown, collapsible tool groups with diff counts, the thought process, permission and question cards.
- Remote Control: continue sessions from the Claude app or claude.ai, and start new ones from the phone.
- Status row with folder, permission mode, model chips, an effort slider and a context ring with plan usage limits.
- Settings for fonts, text sizes, transcript width, the CLI path and session defaults.
- Installed with Setup, Nomad.ai updates itself from GitHub releases.
